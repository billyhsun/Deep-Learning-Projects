# Deep-Learning-Projects
Course Projects from MIE324 Introduction to Machine Intelligence


#### Cats and dogs (Assignment 1):
Training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs

#### Income prediction (Assignment 2):
Coding and training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network to classify income based on individual statistics

#### Mobile phone gesture identification (Assignment 3):
-Utilizes deep learning and convolutional neural networks to process gyroscope data from mobile phones
-Built and created own dataset based on data collected in class
-Achieves 85% accuracy in identifying different phone movements
-Uses Python, PyTorch, Pandas, and Sk-learn

#### Natural language processing (Assignment 4):
-Utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) and a CNN to identify objective vs. subjective sentences
-Achieves 92% accuracy

#### Music genre classifier (Final project):
A music genre classifier trained using deep learning and neural networks, that outputs the predicted genre and confidence level (0-1) of any piece of mp3 audio sample
